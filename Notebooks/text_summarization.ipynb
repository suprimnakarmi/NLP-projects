    "##### Understanding the text and sentence based tokenization in NLP using an example of text summarization. Tokenization is the process of breaking the text into simple readable (or digestable) chunks such that it is easier for computer to have better insight of text later on in NLP tasks. The chunks can be character, word, or sentence. "

Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. One benefit of this will be, you don’t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project. It’s good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best use of the code you are going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Its measures cosine of the angle between vectors. The angle will be 0 if sentences are similar.\""
